# dash_background_callback_test
A simple test repo to show demo a potential issue with background callbacks when moving up from Dash 2.5.1

The ```old.py``` and ```requirements_old.txt``` correspond to the working long callbacks in Dash 2.5.1

The ```new.py``` and ```requirements_new.txt``` correspond to the NOT working use of background callbacks in Dash 2.6.1
